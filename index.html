                <h2>Transition to UWI MONA</h2>

              As a regional student, I had to undertake a challenging and unexpected journey from my own St. Vincent and the Grenadines to Jamacia. I had hoped to begin my classes in the face-to-face format after being accepted in 2021, but the covid epidemic prevented that. I was looking forward to assimilating into Jamaica's Jamaican culture and way of life. After arriving in Jamacia, I participated in all the hall’s activities since I wanted my whole First Year Experience (FYE), since my first year I was robbed. I stepped straight into the orientation process, learning everything I could about UWI and the background and organization of my hall, making friends, and thoroughly enjoying myself. <br>
                    Numerous events were placed in the weeks before school started, and as I've already mentioned, I attended them all to fully participate. A fete and other freshmen competitions were held by the UWI guild. I also attended an event off campus. One of the things I took away from these things was that the Caribbean islands might be separated by the sea, but they are connected through experiences and cultures. I remember conversations I had with the other students, we were talking about doing the same CSEC subjects, and noting the similarities in the way our teachers delivered the material and our experience taking the exam it was the same. We also had a conversation about our school break traditions, going to the beach, playing in the road but making sure to it home before the streetlights come on. We are the same people.

                 I am not great at writng so here is my favourite quotes from great thinkers .<br>
                 Love is many things. It is varied. One thing love is not, is unsure. <span class="emphasized">- Maya Angelou </span> <br>
    
                 Mirror mirror on the wall, it doesn’t matter if I’m short or tall,blue eyes brown eyes , black or green what makes me most beautiful cannot be seen  <span class="emphasized">- 
                     Unknown </span> <br> Beauty is power a smile is its sword.  <span class="emphasized">- John Ray</span> <br> There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. <span class="emphasized">- Patrick Rothfuss</span> <br>Love me or hate me, both are in my favor. If you love me, I’ll always be in your heart.If you hate me, I’ll always be in your mind.<span class="emphasized">- William Spkespare</span> <br>Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.<span class="emphasized">- Ananis Nin</span> <br>You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not.<span class="emphasized">- Jodi Picoult</span> <br>
    
    I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together. <span class="emphasized">- Marilyn Monroe</span> <br>
    Without deep reflection, one knows from daily life that one exists for other people. <span class="emphasized">- Albert Einstein</span> <br>
